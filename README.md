# Language-Translator
Overview
  This repository contains a language translator implemented using machine learning techniques in Python. The translator utilizes a pre-trained model to convert text from one language to another. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient tool for language translation using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

Features :-
  Language translation using a machine learning model.
  Support for multiple languages.
  Easy-to-use Python interface.
  
Requirements :-
  Python 3.x
  Dependencies listed in requirements.txt
  Installation
  
Clone the repository :-
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translator.git

Navigate to the project directory:
  cd language-translator

Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
  Import the Translator class into your Python script or Jupyter notebook:
    from translator import Translator

  Create an instance of the Translator class:
    translator = Translator()

  Translate text from one language to another:
      input_text = "Hello, how are you?"
  output_text = translator.translate(input_text, source_language='en', target_language='fr')
  print(f"Translated text: {output_text}")

  Replace 'en' and 'fr' with the appropriate language codes for your source and target languages.
  
  Run your script or notebook, and enjoy the translated text!
